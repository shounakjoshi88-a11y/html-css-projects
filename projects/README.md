# 📂 Projects Folder

This is where all my actual project work lives. Each folder is a complete project with its own HTML, CSS, and assets.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project folder should have this basic setup:

```
project-name/
├── index.html         # The HTML file
├── style.css          # Your styles go here
├── assets/           # Images, fonts, etc
├── README.md         # Notes about this specific project
```

## 🗂️ Projects Included

- **01-basic-layout/** - Starting with the fundamentals
- **02-responsive-design/** - Making stuff work on mobile
- **03-flexbox-grid/** - Advanced layout techniques
- **04-forms/** - Styling forms and inputs
- **05-components/** - Reusable UI pieces
- **06-animations/** - CSS animations and transitions
- **07-portfolio/** - Putting it all together

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Go into any project folder
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Check out the code
4. Try modifying stuff to see what breaks
5. Have fun!

## 💡 Tips

- Each project builds on what you learned before
- Don't just copy-paste. Type it out
- Open DevTools (F12) and inspect elements
- Try changing CSS values and watch what happens
- Google is your friend when stuck

## 📝 Notes

These projects are all part of my learning journey. Some will be messy, some will be clean. The goal is to understand how things work, not to build production code.

Happy building! 🎉
