# 🎨 HTML & CSS Projects

## 📝 Overview
This is my collection of HTML and CSS projects. I'm using this repo to experiment, learn, and build awesome stuff with web technologies. Every project here represents something I've learned or tried to push my skills with.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Just navigate to any project folder and open `index.html` in your browser. That's it!

```bash
cd projects/01-basic-layout
# Open index.html in your browser
```

## ✨ What I'm Learning

Here's what each project is helping me master:

- 🏷️ **HTML Semantics** - Using proper tags and structure
- 🎯 **CSS Selectors** - Understanding how to target elements
- 📦 **Box Model** - Margins, padding, borders, and sizing
- 🪗 **Flexbox** - Building flexible layouts
- 📊 **CSS Grid** - Creating complex layouts
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Making things work on all screen sizes
- ✨ **Animations** - Adding motion and interactivity

## 🎯 Projects (Coming Soon)

- 📐 **Basic Layouts** - Foundation stuff
- 🍔 **Navigation Menus** - Responsive nav bars
- 📝 **Form Designs** - Pretty forms with validation
- 🎴 **Card Components** - Reusable cards
- 🦸 **Hero Sections** - Eye-catching headers
- 👣 **Footers** - Not just copy-paste stuff
- 💼 **Portfolio Pages** - Putting my best foot forward

## 💡 How I'm Using This

1. **Experiment** - I try different approaches to solve layout problems
2. **Learn** - I study the CSS specs and browser dev tools
3. **Build** - I create projects to actually use the concepts
4. **Refactor** - I come back and improve old code with new knowledge
5. **Share** - This repo helps other students learn too
